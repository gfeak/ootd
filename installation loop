I run Vista Home Premium 32B with Outlook 2003.
Trying to install ootd ends in a loop which repeats the installation of netframework endlessly. 
Thus oOodt is not being installed.
I tried installation both with open and closed Outlook - always with the same result.

So what can be done in order to install Oodt correctly?

Any help will be appreciated.
